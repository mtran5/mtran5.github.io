Hello!

My name is Minh Tran. I'm a third-year PhD candidate in bioengineering.

In this blog I want to write about the things that interest me 
the most: healthcare, machine learning, self-improvement, engineering, and many more.

I hope that each of you find something here that spark your interest.

Cheers,

Minh
