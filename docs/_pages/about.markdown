title: About Me

---

Hello!

My name is Minh Tran. I'm  a first-year PhD candidate in bioengineering.

I have always been interested in the intersection between human and machine.
I believe that in the future, we will be intergrated with hardware systems and become a symbiosis.
(This is not the vision of a far future. Just look around and see how much of us have offloaded our
thinking capabilities to our smartphones)

This belief guides me in my research path. In this blog I will write about the things that interest me 
the most: healthcare, machine learning, self-improvement, engineering, and many more.

I hope that each of you find something here that spark your interest.

Cheers,

Minh
