Machine learning libraries accelerate the deep learning revolution. 
They lowered the barrier of entry for practitioners by abstracting many difficult 
things such as GPU speedup, matrix algebra, and automatic differentiation. 
In both industries and academia, two deep learning libraries reign supreme: 
PyTorch and TensorFlow. In this article, I will introduce you to some other 
deep learning libraries that have considerable usage, either because they achieve 
speedup in some ways, or because they are used by very specific groups. Letâ€™s begin!
